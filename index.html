                My name is Clayton Ortiz and I am a future web developer. My goal is to be in the web and software development field within 2 months of my graduating the UMN Web Dev Bootcamp. I currently work
                at Wells Fargo as a Loan Servicing Specialist. I graduated in the spring of 2019 from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Economics. I hope to not only work for a 
                company in the field of web development but develop some of my very own applications and possibly start my own company.

                Outside of my professional career and aspirations I enjoy a lot of different activities. I am very and active try to work out a few times a week. After working out I like to cook and try
                new recipes for dinner. On the weekends I try my best to spend time with my friends and family.
